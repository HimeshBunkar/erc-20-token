# erc-20-token
ERC-20 is a technical standard for creating interchangeable, or fungible, tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Think of it as a common set of rules that a token contract must follow. This ensures that all ERC-20 tokens work the same way and are compatible with various wallets, decentralized exchanges, and other applications.
